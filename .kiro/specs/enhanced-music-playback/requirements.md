## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing music therapy functionality by enabling multiple song playback and expanding the English song library to include actual songs with vocals rather than just instrumental music. The enhancement will provide users with a more comprehensive and engaging music therapy experience that can play continuous playlists and offer a richer variety of vocal music for emotional support.
