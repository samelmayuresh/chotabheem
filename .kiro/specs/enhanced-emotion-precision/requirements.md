# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhancement aims to significantly improve the precision and accuracy of emotion detection in the Emotion AI platform through both text analysis and voice analysis methods. The current system uses basic models that can be enhanced with advanced techniques, ensemble methods, preprocessing improvements, and multimodal fusion to achieve higher accuracy and more nuanced emotion recognition.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user analyzing text emotions, I want the system to detect emotions with higher precision and confidence, so that I can trust the emotional insights provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs text for emotion analysis THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 90% accuracy on standard emotion datasets
2. WHEN the system analyzes ambiguous emotional text THEN it SHALL provide confidence scores above 0.8 for clear emotions and appropriate uncertainty indicators for mixed emotions
3. WHEN processing long text passages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent emotion detection across different text segments
4. WHEN analyzing context-dependent emotions like sarcasm THEN the system SHALL correctly identify the underlying emotional intent
5. IF the text contains multiple emotions THEN the system SHALL detect and rank all significant emotions with their respective confidence levels

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user providing voice input, I want the system to accurately detect emotions from my speech patterns and vocal characteristics, so that I receive relevant emotional support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides voice input THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 85% accuracy in voice emotion recognition
2. WHEN analyzing speech with background noise THEN the system SHALL maintain emotion detection accuracy above 75%
3. WHEN processing different accents and speaking styles THEN the system SHALL adapt and provide consistent emotion recognition
4. WHEN detecting vocal stress indicators THEN the system SHALL identify subtle emotional cues beyond basic emotions
5. IF the voice input is unclear or low quality THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate confidence indicators and request clarification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user providing both text and voice input, I want the system to combine insights from both modalities for more accurate emotion detection, so that I get the most comprehensive emotional analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both text and voice data are available THEN the system SHALL fuse multimodal information to improve overall accuracy by at least 15%
2. WHEN text and voice emotions conflict THEN the system SHALL intelligently weight and resolve conflicts based on confidence levels and context
3. WHEN one modality has low confidence THEN the system SHALL rely more heavily on the higher-confidence modality
4. WHEN real-time analysis is required THEN the multimodal fusion SHALL complete processing within 3 seconds
5. IF only one modality is available THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade while maintaining high accuracy for the available input

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer or researcher, I want access to advanced emotion analysis features and customization options, so that I can fine-tune the system for specific use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN developers SHALL be able to select from multiple precision levels (fast, balanced, high-precision)
2. WHEN training on custom data THEN the system SHALL support fine-tuning of emotion models with user-provided datasets
3. WHEN analyzing domain-specific text THEN the system SHALL allow loading of specialized emotion models (medical, educational, social media)
4. WHEN processing non-English content THEN the system SHALL support multilingual emotion detection with comparable accuracy
5. IF custom emotion categories are needed THEN the system SHALL allow definition and training of custom emotion taxonomies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and analytics for emotion detection performance, so that I can ensure the system maintains high accuracy over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes emotions THEN it SHALL log detailed performance metrics including accuracy, confidence, and processing time
2. WHEN accuracy drops below thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts and suggest model retraining
3. WHEN analyzing usage patterns THEN the system SHALL provide insights into emotion detection trends and model performance
4. WHEN comparing different models THEN the system SHALL provide A/B testing capabilities with statistical significance testing
5. IF bias is detected in emotion recognition THEN the system SHALL flag potential issues and suggest corrective measures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user concerned about privacy, I want emotion detection to work locally without sending sensitive data to external services, so that my emotional data remains private and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing emotions locally THEN the system SHALL achieve comparable accuracy to cloud-based solutions
2. WHEN running on limited hardware THEN the system SHALL provide optimized models that balance accuracy and performance
3. WHEN storing emotion data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all emotional analysis results
4. WHEN using cloud services THEN the system SHALL provide clear opt-in/opt-out mechanisms for external API usage
5. IF internet connectivity is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue functioning with local models at full capability
